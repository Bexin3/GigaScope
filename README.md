Compatible with any arduino boards with analog input.
This library is still in development, and I recommend using it with a board with enough memory to store enough samples to improve accuracy, and with a library that allows for high speed analog reading if you plan to meassure higher frequencies. For now the frequency reader example shows how to basically use the library.
Legacy frequency reader uses previous one by one functions instead of one that does all, so is better to get understanding of the code.
