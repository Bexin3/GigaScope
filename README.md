Compatible with Giga R1 wifi, portenta h7 and possibly other stm32h747 boards.

As of now this library is still in development, as well as its doccumentation.

At the moment, the library provides examples to plot graph with STMSpeeduino, as well as 3 functions, one to find array minimum and maximum, one to find boundary values, and one to find frequency and duty cycle. All three functions return structs. These functions are to be found in the frequency finder example.
